The Reasoning
------------------------------------

Q: Why Arch?

A: Arch comes with a built in ISO builder which requires all package managers and stuff to be added directly.

Since Cirbuntu is based on Ubuntu's desktop environment having a good grasp on the customization in terms of desktops and such would allow a good enough emulation of an Ubuntu desktop to make up the base distro change.

Plan for this README
----------------------------------

This documentation will be updated as the community continues to develop this Distro but a dedicated wiki will be implemented if enough requests come through.

This should be publicly accessible to contributors but if not the README can always be updated monthly to document and archive updates and changes to the distro.
